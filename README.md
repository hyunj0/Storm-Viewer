# Storm Viewer

This project is from Hacking With Swift [Project 1: Storm Viewer](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/1/overview).

[Paul Hudson](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/about) already does a great job to guide you to build your own Storm Viewer, also providing the [source code](https://github.com/twostraws/HackingWithSwift/tree/master/project1).

I just made a variation where I don't use storyboards and build my UI programmatically. I did need to keep the `LaunchScreen.storyboard` though because Apple requires it [source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11117556/is-a-splash-screen-necessary-for-an-iphone-app).

I also completed the challenges at the end of the tutorial.
